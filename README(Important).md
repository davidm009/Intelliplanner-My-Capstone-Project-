# React + Vite

To use the AI portion of this app, you will need a .env file of your own.
Make sure to copy the OPENAI_API_KEY format from the .env.example file to your .env file. This is very important!
You can see specific instructions in the .env.example file. Your env file will be used to connect to your OpenAI API Ke.
Make sure you have your OpenAI API Key to place it into the actual .env file.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
